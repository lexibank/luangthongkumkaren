Notes			N.Sgaw and S.Pwo have tone A instead of tone B. The two varieties of Pwo have irregular vowels.	Irregular vowels in Kayah (KH) and Kayaw (KW), i.e. they should be /e/ and /a/ in KH and KW, respectively. S.Karen (SK) tones suggest *bl-, while those in N.Karen (NK) indicate *pl-.		In some N.Sgaw varieties phla¹¹ ~̈ pha¹¹ ̈ means ‘fireplace’.							Pa-O and Sgaw have tone A while C.Karen (CK) languages and Pwo have tone B. *pl- has become bl- in Sgaw.	N.Sgaw has the B3 tone while S. Sgaw has the B1 tone as in Pwo and Pa-O.			This etymon has irregular tone change, i.e. *D has become tone A in S.Sgaw and Pwo. Perhaps, the final *-t had been dropped much earlier, then the *D tone became the *A tone.					The words meaning ‘bird’ in N.PO and S.PO are wa⁵³(B3) and wa⁵⁵(B3), respectively.						*kl- has become phr- and pl- in N.Pa-O and S.Pa-O. respectively.			This etymon has irregular tone changes in SK, i.e. tone A in Sgaw and tone B in Pwo, while it is still tone D in NK and CK. The final *-t might have been dropped very early; consequently, the tones in Sgaw and Pwo have developed differently.								It is noticeable that NK has tone B while CK and SK have tone A.		N.Pwo has tone A which is irregular.	NK and Kayan (CK) have tone A while the rest have tone B.	Kayan has an irregular vowel, /o/ instead of /ɨ/. N.Sgaw also has an irregular tone, tone D.				[Proto-Monic: *tyaaŋ, Proto-Mon: *caiɲ (Diffloth, 1984)]	NK and CK have tone D while SK languages have irregular tone changes, i.e. *D>A in Sgaw but >B in Pwo.	[Thai: khaaŋ33]				The correspondence pattern of rhymes in SK suggests *Ɂbajᴮ [Thai: baj33]								The SK tones suggest tone *A in PK.				ki⁵³ in Kayan is a kind of grub.					Sgaw has tone A while Pwo, NK and CK have tone B.		Pwo has an irregular initial. It should be /d-/ instead of /th-/.								In SK, the rhyme *-oɁᴰ has become -ɔᴬ (SG, N.PW) and -oᴬ (S.PW).					In N.Pwo, it is an irregular tone change, i.e. tone 55 (A23) instead of tone 35 (A1) as in Sgaw, NK and CK.														Kayan has an irregular onset, i.e. /t-/ instead of /d-/.		The D3 tone in NK and Pwo suggests *gr- while the D12 tone in Kayan and Sgaw indicates *khr-.					Pa-O and N.Sgaw have tone D12 which suggests *p- in PK.										It is noticeable that Sgaw and Pwo (SK) have tone B3.			S.Pa-O, Pwo and some varieties of Sgaw have tone A, while CK has tone D.					The PK form cannot be reconstructed since PNK, PCK and PSK have different onsets and tones.								The initial th- and tone B3 in Pwo suggest a plain voiced *d- in PK. Probably, *ɗ- in PK became *d- in Pwo and then *d- became /th-/.	There is an irregular tone change in Bwe. The A3 tone in Bwe should be 33, not 11.													NK has the A tone instead of the B tone as in CK and SK.	Bwe has an irregular tone. Modern Bwe should have tone 33(A3) instead of Tone 11 (D3).	In SK *phr- has become phl-.	The PK tone cannot be reconstructed due to the fact that NK, CK and SK have tones A, D and B, respectively. This etymon is an Austroasiatic loanword. The reconstructed form for ‘horse’ in Proto- Monic is *ksɛh (Diffloth 1984).					Pwo has an unusal onset, xw- .					NK, CK and Sgaw (SK) have tone D12; however, it is D3 in both N.Pwo and S.Pwo.				Some Karenic languages have tone D12 which suggests *pl-, e.g. N.Pa-O, Bwe and some varieties of Sgaw. However, both N.Pwo and S.Pwo have the D3 tone which indicates a plain voiced *bl-.		Kayan has an irregular vowel, ai; the regular one should be ɨ.	The initial khw- in Pwo is irregular.														Pwo has tone D while CK and Sgaw have tone B.					Kayah has an irregular vowel, /a/ instead of /e/. Bwe and Pwo have tone B while the rest have tone A.		NK, CK and S.Pwo have tone A while Sgaw and N.PWO have tone B.				Only N.Sgaw has tone D instead of A.					Irregular vowels in CK, i.e. the vowel changes behave like the *-a rhyme pattern, not the *-aŋ one.											The tone of this etymon cannot be reconstructed due to its regularity. Very often, the word ‘one’ is unstressed, so its vowel has been reduced. Moreover, in some CK languages there is also the harmony of vowels in sesquisyllabic words, t 'C .			NK and CK have tone A3 which indicates a voice onset *ɲ- but the tone A12 in SK suggests a voiceless onset *hɲ-.	S.Pwo has an irregular vowel, i.e. it should be u not ɨ.								Kayah and Sgaw have irregular vowels, i.e. /u/ instead of /ɔ/ (Kayah) and /u/ instead of /ə/ (Sgaw).	N.Sgaw has tone D while the rest have tone A.												The SK languages have irregular tone changes, i.e. Sgaw has tone A while Pwo has tone B.						S.Sgaw has tone B. Perhaps, the word thwɛ⁵⁵ in S.Pwo was borrowed from S.Sgaw, thwɛ⁵⁵. There is no cognate in N.Pwo.									Only Sgaw has tone A while Pwo (SK), NK and CK have tone B.			Two protoforms which have tone A (CK, S.Sgaw, Pwo) and tone D (NK, N.Sgaw) can be reconstructed. However, the correspondence of vowels is problematical.			It is noticeable that the Christian Karen seem to remember the word ‘sheep’ quite well. However, this word has tone A in CK and Sgaw while it has tone B in NK and Pwo.										Tone A3 in NK and CK suggests a voiceless onset (*hn-) but tone A12 in Sgaw and tone A1 in Pwo indicate a voiced onset *n-.					The correspondence pattern of vowels in SK suggests *-ɛN.	Bwe has an irregular tone, i.e. tone 11 (D3) instead of tone 33 (A3) as in the other Karenic languages.	N. Sgaw has an irregular tone, i.e. tone D, while the rest have tone A.						N.Sgaw has tone D while the other Karenic languages have tone B.													Sgaw and N.Pwo have irregular vowel, i.e. /ɛ/ instead of /e/.					Pwo vowels are irregular, i.e. /ai/ and /ɛi/ instead of /ei/.	Pwo has tone B3 which suggests a voiced onset *bl-.			*hreŋᴬ = thousand (amount of money), *g-thɔNᴬ = thousand (people)						NK has the B tone while CK and SK have tone A.				CK has irregular vowels.		Pwo has irregular vowels, i.e. /ãi/ instead of /ɛ̃/ (N.PW) and /ɔ̃/ (S.PN).										It is not certain if the *-a or *-aN rhyme should be reconstructed. S.Pa-O, Sgaw and S.Pwo suggest *-aN while the rest indicate *-a.	Bwe has an irregular vowel, i.e. /a/ instead of /ɛ/.
